When there's a new update, you need to update some new characters yourself
Make this list as short as possible

char-id.json - Add the new character and their ID
characters.json - Rename the name of the trailblazer to "Trailblazer" and not "{NICKNAME}" (index_new)
elements.json - If there are new elements, add it to this
