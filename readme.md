This is a Discord bot based on Honkai: Star Rail\
You can access your in-game profile information, and I'm in the process of implementing an economy system with wishing, inventories, and assignments with your collected characters

It utilizes the [StarRailRes](https://github.com/Mar-7th/StarRailRes) repository for the library\
and the [MiHoMo API](https://march7th.xiaohei.moe/en/resource/mihomo_api.html) for Fetch API calls to the game

Most of the code is by me, but I own none of the assets
