This is a Discord bot based on Honkai: Star Rail\
There are commands for accessing in-game profile information, as well as an economy based around the game with wishes, teams, assignments, and daily missions

Additionally, there is a chat command that connects with c.ai to chat with AI characters using [node_characterai](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai), but my code is fairly unstable

It utilizes the [StarRailRes](https://github.com/Mar-7th/StarRailRes) repository for the library\
<del>and the [MiHoMo API](https://march7th.xiaohei.moe/en/resource/mihomo_api.html) to call information from the game</del>\
and the [Enka API](https://enka.network/) to call information from the game

Most of the code is by me, but I own none of the assets
